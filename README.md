# Empirical_Mode_Decomposition

<img src="/emd_toy_signal.jpg?raw=true">

This project is a MATLAB implementation of the concepts found in this [conference paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221534245_Empirical_Mode_Decomposition_-_an_introduction).

A simple graphical explanation of the EMD algorithm can be found in how_to_obtain_components.m and how_to_obtain_imf.m.

Applying the EMD method to a toy signal ca be found in test_emd.m.

For test purposes, EKG and EEG signal data can be found [here](http://people.ucalgary.ca/~ranga/enel563/SIGNAL_DATA_FILES/).
